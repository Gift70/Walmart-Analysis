**KEY FINDINGS**

1. Revenue-Driving Product Lines:
Food and Beverages dominated sales with $53,471.28 (952 units sold), showing strong customer demand and high satisfaction (average rating: 7.11).

Despite strong revenue, Health and Beauty and Home and Lifestyle generated lower total sales ($46,851.18 and $51,297.06, respectively), indicating opportunities to boost their performance through promotions or targeted marketing.

2. Customer Payment Preferences:
Cash is the most used payment method, accounting for $106,863.40 in sales (1,896 units sold) , slightly outperforming Ewallet payments ($104,755.34).

Encouraging Ewallet use through rewards or loyalty points could drive higher adoption, aligning with global cashless payment trends

3. Branch Performance and Regional Insights:
Branch B in Mandalay emerged as the highest-grossing location, with $37,215.93 in total sales, outperforming other branches across regions.

Lower-performing branches could benefit from adopting strategies employed in Mandalay, such as optimizing inventory and targeting products with proven demand.
Nevertheless, Naypyitaw consistently showed strong sales across multiple branches, highlighting it as a key regional market for investment.

4. Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty:
High-performing categories like Fashion Accessories (7.03) and Food and Beverages (7.11) enjoyed strong customer ratings, but lower satisfaction for Sports and Travel (6.92) and Home and Lifestyle (6.83) signals areas for improvement.
Tailoring customer experiences in these categories could drive repeat purchases.

6. Daily Sales Trends:
Certain dates and times see spikes in sales, driven by specific product lines or customer behavior. These peaks could reflect payday effects, holidays, or promotional periods.

**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**:

1. Focus on Customer-Centric Growth: Product lines with weaker satisfaction ratings—such as Home and Lifestyle—could benefit from tailored promotions or better inventory planning to improve customer loyalty and boost sales.

Bundle Offers: Pair high-demand items (e.g., Food and Beverages) with underperforming categories (Health and Beauty) to increase cross-category sales.

2.  Accelerate Digital Payment Adoption: With Ewallet nearly overtaking cash, Walmart should capitalize on this trend by offering discounts or loyalty points for digital transactions, catering to the growing preference for cashless convenience.

3.  Optimize Branch Operations: Underperforming branches should replicate successful strategies from Mandalay, including demand forecasting and sales-focused workforce training.

4. Sales Trend Promotions: Introduce discounts during low-demand days to balance sales and avoid revenue slumps.
Inventory Planning: Use historical trends to stock high-demand items before peak sales days, minimizing out-of-stock situations.

**TAKEAWAYS**:
